♟️ Chess Game (Python)
Overview

A fully functional chess engine in Python, built to explore object-oriented design and apply clean software engineering practices to a classic board game.
The project supports both human vs. human matches and a basic AI opponent.

The focus was not only on gameplay, but also on maintainability, clarity, and extensibility of the codebase.

Features

✅ Standard chess rules (piece movement, captures, check, checkmate).

👥 Two modes: human vs. human, human vs. computer (basic AI).

🧩 Object-Oriented Design: each piece encapsulated with its own logic.

🔍 Move validation and detection of check/checkmate.

🏗️ Modular structure → easy to extend with new features (e.g., better AI, GUI).

Technical Details

Language: Python 3

Design: OOP (classes for each piece, board, and game controller).

AI: simple heuristic-based move selection for computer opponent.

Lessons Learned

Applying OOP principles to structure game logic in a clean, reusable way.

Writing code with a focus on maintainability and possible future improvements.

First-hand experience in separating game logic from presentation to enable future GUI development.
